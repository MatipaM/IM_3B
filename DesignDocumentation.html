    <h1>Planning Documentation for Static Data Visualisations</h1>

<p>
    I decided to use a scatter graph because their main function is to show the correlation between the values on the x and y axis. 
    I wanted to see whether the x and y variables were dependent on one another. I also aimed to draw the user’s attention my main point, which was what aspects I though may have contributed to Studio Ghibli’s success by examining when their movies were most popular and how long each movies was.
	As I know movie length can affect how viewer’s feel about certain films, for example if they felt that the content could have been told in a smaller amount of time, or if they felt that certain points needed to be expanded on.

    I started by drawing sketches of how I wanted to represent my data, then plotted my data in d3. 
    After that I was able to see my graph on my website. 
    I then made observations based on how the graph came out and researched what different scatter graphs meant.
    I used the research I had done to come up with a conclusion based on the data the graph had produced.

    The <a href="https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#" class="hyperlink">Studio Ghibli API</a> had several different sections such as the films, people, locations, species and vehicles.
    I chose to focus mainly on films as I thought it would be considered the most interesting topic to a wider range of people.
    I felt that going into specifics such as people and species would be too specialised as only extremely invested fans would recognise the names of characters from several different movies.
    Especially considering that one of the aims of my website is to encourage people who have never heard of Studio Ghibli to watch some of their films.
    Initially I had thought of using the 'people' API and mapping characters against race to see how diverse Studio Ghibli’s characters are, however as a Japanese studio, it does make sense that all of their characters are Japanese (and the API did not specify race). 
    I also wanted to try looking at different vehicles used, and how many of each vehivle appeared in each movie/how many movies did different types of vehicles appear in - although they were only three different types of vehicles in the API which I felt was not enough variety to make an analysis, let alone come to any sort of conclusion.
