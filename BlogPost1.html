        <h1>Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation</h1>

        <p>
            This essay will begin by defining what data visualisation is as well as what roles it plays in our everyday lives. Then it will explore the advantages of data visualisations, the role of the viewers who engage with these visualisations as well as how and why certain knowledge is privileged when creating them.
</p>

<p>
Qi Li, in his essay, ‘Overview of Data Visualisation’ (2020), defines it as “the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format” (Li, 2020). Li expands on this statement by emphasising the intuitive and interactive experience data visualisation provides for viewers (Li, 2020). The main goal of traditional data visualisation is to communicate a range of pre-selected information to viewers. Visualising data has several advantages such as the ability to display a large volume of information (defined as processed/meaningful data) to viewers. It also allows viewers to build upon the original data set to either formulate their own future predictions or to identify unforeseen correlations within the data. Another advantage is also how much more accessible data is for the general public, as it incorporates younger audiences and begins to destroy the mental barrier for those who believe only science-minded people can engage with these datasets. However, another side to this is that it encourages an overloading of information e.g., visualisations present much more information than a summary would.  They are also playing a bigger role in popular media, in the sense that with the evolution of social media, analytics are becoming a larger prioritisation for casual users.
</p>

<p>
Li explains how the data visualisation is split into two major sub classes. The first is information visualisation. Information visualisation is the visual representation of abstract data (Li, 2020). Abstract data is “the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole” (What is data abstraction in programming and database management?, 2022). This requires the person visualising and/or organising the original data set to select which parts of the data they see as most valuable. Hence introducing a system of validation where certain data is privileged over other data in order to produce a more comprehensible visualisation. In this way the creator’s “ways of knowing”( Rettberg, 2020) are privileged as they get to decide what “kinds of knowledge” (Rettberg, 2020) to enable.
</p>

<p>
The other subclass of data visualisation is scientific visualisation. Scientific visualisation is described as the representation of what is normally physically based scientific data (Li, 2020). Scientific data is “information which is based on research carried out by scientists and which has been published in a peer-reviewed journal” (Scientific Data Definition | Law Insider, 2022).
</p>

<p>
Li goes on to define the differences between data and information as well as provide a deeper examination into the different types of data. Data is defined as “raw, unprocessed information” (Li, 2020) that is not associated with a particular meaning. They are two main types of data, primary and secondary data. Primary data is “collected from the […] individual respondents directly” (Li, 2020) whereas secondary data is data collected from other sources (not done by the researcher) for a purpose that is different from that in which the original data was gathered. Lastly, information is defined as meaningful data.
</p>

<p>
Data visualisation is considered an interactive activity therefore it is the role of the viewer to perceive the data being displayed to them. Perception is “the process of recognising […], organising […] and interpreting […] sensory information” (Li, 2020). Floridi and Chen in their essay, ‘An analysis of information visualisation’ (2013) describe viewing as “the process of specifying significant or noteworthy information” (2013). This emphasises how great the role of the viewer is when it comes to conveying information, as a visualisation becomes pointless if viewers are not able to engage with it. It is within the viewing process that users can make judgements about how this information will affect their lives e.g. during COVID-19, data visualisations encouraged the use of masks by visualising how affective they were in preventing the spread of the virus. Viewers can also form their own hypothesis based on previously defined data visuals, that is they can use previously made data visuals as secondary data for their own research.  
</p>

<p>
The heavy reliance on viewers’ ability to engage with the visualisations introduces new inequalities in the form of “access to the kinds of literacies needed for making sense of data visualisations” (Hiippala, 2020). Hiippala describes the term ‘ergodic work’ as the amount of effort required from participants. In the case of data visualisation, ergodic work is directly correlated to exploration. Hippala defines exploration as the “degree of interacticity” provided for users (Hippala, 2020). The more interaction a visualisation contains the more ergodic work is required from the viewer to fully comprehend the displayed data. Some viewers have expressed that if a visualisation takes too much ergodic work, they will avoid interacting with the visualisation, as they see it as work which “does not come easily” (Kennedy, Allen, Engebretsen, Hill, Kirk, Weber, 2021).
</p>

<p>
The particular layouts of a space affect how viewers relate to data (Hippala, 2020). Hence why data has a number of different formats it can be organised into such as graphs, charts, tables etc. The notion of space changing how we relate to data is applicable to the physical media in which we display these visualisations. Mobile devices have become the leading device for these types of interactions resulting in the “widespread adoption of mobile first” (Kennedy et al., 2021) this opens doors for new levels of interaction where using your finger to scroll down a page is likely to reveal some sort of technical effect.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to structures of power, society has given “systemised data” (Rettberg, 2020)  a high level of authority. This can be seen in the way data visualisations have privileged the average to a position where it is not only idealised but seen as the goal. The idealised average comes in opposition to earlier traditions which praised an ideal body, that was encouraged to be worked towards but ultimately was seen as unachievable (Rettberg, 2020). Modern day society has created a place of comfort with the average, as users, we are more concerned with whether something is ‘normal’ and take pride when our statistics are within these bounds of normalcy. However as consumers, we should be aware that normalcy tends to be measured by those with the most power as opposed to those with the greatest knowledge, as a result countries affected by the digital divide tend to have much less of a say than other countries.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, this essay has touched upon what data visualisation is as well as its advantages to society. It has highlighted how data visualisation encourages the average person to act and even encourages them to observe the data in a critical manner so that they are able to come to their own hypothesis. It has explained how knowledge barriers affect different interaction rates with visualisations, as overwhelming visualisations require more ergodic work from the user. It explores how visualisations can create a space which supports and encourages interaction but sometimes still does not allow the user to contribute meaningfully to the data. Data visualisation in itself encourages certain ideologies and predefined beliefs whilst suppressing others therefore users should engage with them critically in order to be in control of their own truth.
