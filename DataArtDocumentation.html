    <h1>Planning Documentation for Data Art</h1>

<p>
    For this submission, I decided to create a collage for my data art. Initially I had thought of creating a colourscript which would have taken the main color from each image in the data set. As my data set was made up of the cover from each Studio Ghibli movie. However, I felt that this would not make sense for a viewer and would rather come off as confusing. Therefore, I thought it would be better to produce a collage. </p>

    <p>
        When the user hovers over an image, the title of the movie and a short description appears. This way the user can more intuitively navigate to a movie cover which attracts their eye (as opposed to just navigating through colours) and then hover to find out more information. The image the users hovers over, will enlarge in size. This communicates clearly which movie the description and title are referring to. I ensured the information appeared on hover because I wanted the way my user experiences the data art to stay consistent with my data visualizations. I did this to build up user expectations when navigating throughout my website. I also felt a collage was more visually appealing. Hence, why I created an algorithm to ensure that the images would resize themselves when refreshed, and I also ensured that the higher-ranking films would be displayed in a slightly larger manner, to increase visibility of films that were better enjoyed by audiences. I think my data art works alongside my data visualization to increase user appeal to Studio Ghibli, as it both qualitatively and quantitatively shows off the best sides to the franchise. That is by displaying a snapshot of their art style and showing off their high ratings.
