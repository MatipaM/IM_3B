    Close Reading - Interaction for Data Visualisation
</h1>
    </section>

    <p>
        In this essay I will be analysing the paper, ‘Interaction for Data Visualisation’ (2019) by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin. The aim of the paper is to provide a definition for what interaction means in the world of data visualisation. I will discuss how Dimara and Perin gathered data for their study and what aspects of interaction they considered when producing their definition of interaction.     </p>

    <p>
        Dimara and Perin begin the paper by defining their criteria for the data their study will be based on. One of these requirements emphasises the difference between interaction within the context of data visualisation and that of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Dimara and Perin insist that any mention of interaction within the field of HCI is not valid within their study unless it explicitly speaks about interaction within data visualisation as well. This emphasises the fact that how a user engages with information displayed to them, will depend on what information you as the developer are trying to convey. Hence, designing a user interface for a theory blog webpage requires different design considerations than when condensing data from an API onto a visualisation. Interactions within data visualisations can be more complex than HCI in the sense that the designer is trying to portray a large volume of information in a manner that “strengthen[s the] viewer’s understanding of the underlying data” (Roels, Baeten,and Signer, 2016). The designer encourages viewers to identify trends in the data as “[h]umans have a remarkable pattern recognition system … the ability for knowledge discovery in data-driven science depends critically on our ability to perform effective and flexible visual exploration” (Teras and Raghunathan, 2015).     </p> 

<p>
    Before diving into the definition of interaction, Dimara and Perin begin by identifying key aspects of interaction such as ‘user’ and ‘data’. Dimara et al. expands on the link between user and data by exploring how “[i]nteraction is conceptualised as a dialogue between a human user and the visualisation system over a central object of interest: the data” (Dimara and Perin, 2019). They go on to define the user as “a human being who can be characterised by skills, abilities, expertise and motivation, and who initiates the interaction” (Dimara and Perin, 2019). It is noted the term, ‘user’ does not exclude entities which may be considered to be non-human. Dimara et al. define data as “an intangible information source that is the user’s main object of interest”(Dimara and Perin, 2019). I would argue that the information source itself is not the user’s main interest but rather the trends we pick up whilst analysing the data, that becomes our main focus. </p>


<p>
    Dimara et al. propose the scope for what makes up an interaction, this ranges from physical interaction, user interactions, the user’s mental representations as well as internal interactions which take place as thoughts in the user’s mind. Dimara et al. go on to list the properties of interaction such as the fact that it tends to be goal oriented, executed one step at a time in a sequential manner, repeatedly. Interactions can be subdivided into two characters, continuous and discrete. Continuous interactions “involve a sequence of intermediate visualisation states between an initial state and a goal state which happen over a span of time” (Dimara and Perin, 2019). Whereas, discrete interactions “occur in a distinct manner” (Dimara and Perin, 2019). </p>

    <p>
        Even though the seven categories of Human Computer Interaction are functional within the realm of data visualisation, they are key differences between how interaction is expected to operate within the two contexts. Dimara et al. highlights these differences, starting with entities at play, the HCI review points out that interaction involves “two entities … engaged in an interplay of sorts” (Hornbaek and Oulasvirta, 2017), however in the field of data visualisation, this interaction must involve data. HCI aims to make the interface as simple and intuitive as possible whereas VIS (visualisation) aids the user in manipulating (e.g. filtering) the data in order to identify trends and outliers. VIS works on “providing users more control over the visualisation process in order to enable the interactive exploration and discovery of meaningful relations” (Roels et al., 2016). The goals of the user also differ as with HCI, goals may be formed “outside of the interaction cycle” (Dimara and Perin, 2017). For example, one may want to transfer money to someone, they can decide to use a banking application to do so, but their intention was not formed because they were using the app, rather they are using the app because of their intention. This is opposed to data visualisation where engaging with a visualisation, may persuade one to filter the data in different ways in order to find other corresponding trends, in this case, my engagement is directly affected by the visualisation conveyed to me and the information it is displaying.    </p>

<p>
    In conclusion, this essay has included a review of Dimara et al.’s demonstration of how interaction differs within the context it is used and how user intent affects the way an interface is developed to encourage interaction. They end their paper by defining interaction for visualisation as “the interplay between a person and a data interface involving a data-related intent, at least one action from the person and an interface reaction that is perceived as such” (Dimara and Perin, 2017). This definition acknowledges that data and the user are key aspects for communication. It also addresses that the system must react in response to the user’s input.
