<p>I wanted my website to have a cloudy dream-like feel to it, which is why I used opaque white boxes as the background text. 
    I also wanted to create a steeper contrast between text and background as neither black or white text can be seen clearly on the pages which had the Studio Ghibli art.
I kept the same colour theme from my last submission, as I think the green's and blues fit in well with the Studio Ghibli theme.
I am still using the font 'Tahoma', from my last submission as I enjoy how easy it is to read, and the increased font weight stands out nicely on a lightly coloured page.
This submission I focused on aligning different items on the page together, as I wanted headings and text heavy paragraphs to look more structured when placed on the same page.</p>

<p>When it comes to my data visualisations, I aligned them side by side, however for the next assignment I want to make it more interactive so that when the user clicks on a point on the graph, it displays the title, an image and description of the movie next to the graph. 
    As well as a 'next' button which will cycle through all the movies, whilst highlighting the selected point on the graph. 
    That way the user can see the selected movie in relation to its corresponding data on the visualisation.
As currently, the data is on the graphs is not linked to the movie titles, which makes it difficult for the user to identify which movies are the anamolies.</p>

<p>In the future I would like to implement the scrolling effect which can be seen on Appleâ€™s website. This effect consists of animations which run when the user scrolls through the webpage. 
I plan to add these animations in, but with small snippets from the Studio Ghibli movie running when the user scrolls. I would also like to allow the user to customise certain aspects of the website, whether that be by uploading a profile picture or saving their favourite movie data, however, this would require me to do some more research on the back-end as personalised information would need to be saved on some sort of database.
