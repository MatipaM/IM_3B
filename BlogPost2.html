<h1>
    UI/UX Critical Writing Analysis
</h1>
    </section>

    <p>“Design is the conscious intuitive effort to impose meaningful order” (Papanek, 1984). When designing my User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX), I aimed to design an environment which evoked positive emotions within the user. This meant avoiding any sort of possible frustrations by communicating clearly to my user where information was located and how to complete each task (Hassenzahl and Tractinsky 2006). </p>
    <p>Hassenzahl and Trackinsky in their paper, ‘User Experience a Research Agenda’ (2006) speak of having emotions as design goals. Even though it cannot be guaranteed that the user will feel joy and/or excitement when they look at my website. I have still made certain design decisions in order to subtly alter how the user feels when engaging with my website. Aiming to alter how a user feels may be considered a dark UX pattern as the designer’s intentions are not being clearly stated to the user (Goldberg, 2022). I chose to go with a lighter/happy theme such as ‘Studio Ghibli’ (1985) because I wanted the user to be drawn in by the visual aesthetic of the website. I also aimed to emulate similar feelings to those that would be evoked when watching the movie, that is feelings having been whisked away to another world. I wanted to captivate users who may not have watched any ‘Studio Ghibli’ (1985) movies or had any experience with the primary data the website is based on to feel as though they wanted to learn more about the studio. UX management speaks to the designers ability to influence how the user behaves (Goldberg, 2022). My website at the moment, lacks any explicit call to action’s (CTA) as it does not have any underlying aim to generate some sort of gain e.g. financial. However, it does attempt to influence the user’s behaviour, by trying to provoke a set of positive emotions when the user interacts with the website</p> 
<p>Another way, I attempted to produce positive emotions within users is by layering information in a logical structure. I grouped information using a hierarchical layout, with the most important information at the top of the page, that being the navigation bar followed by the heading of the webpage underneath it. I wanted to reflect the idea of conscious effort by purposefully grouping elements such as navigation icons in areas that were instantly visible to the user. I also made sure the current page the user was on was highlighted, and that the navigation bar was static, so as to provide a reference point for the user. I wanted the pages to have a minimalistic look because they contain a lot of bright greens and blues in the background therefore I did not want them to come off as overwhelming. To avoid this I removed individual references and placed them on their own separate page and I also tried to create high contrast between the text and  the background by adding a white background for big buttons. On pages with a lot of text, I removed the background image and included a solid turquoise background instead as shown in the Figure 1 wireframes. I decided to go with a green and blue colour because I liked that they can be considered earthy colours, whilst also being vibrant enough to create a positive environment. I used white to contrast against these colours because I thought a dark background with white text would seem too gloomy. I decided to use the font Coda_Caption because its font weight stood out on the bright Studio Ghibli background, and was quite easy to skim when placed in paragraphs, however a downside to this font is that it is not dyslexia friendly as certain letters when reversed look identical to others.</p>

<p>“The web encourages a predator’s glance, processing a vast amount of fleeting information fast, before focusing on a target” (Blair-Early and Zender, 2008). Another reason why I did not want my pages to look overloaded was because I wanted to make it easy for people skimming my website to get a good idea of what each page was about. For that reason, I created five tabs in my navigation which separated the home page, from the blogs, data, design and references. From there, the blogs, data and design have their own sub sections which the user can select from. I grouped sections in this manner to reduce complexity and the number of decisions a user is faced with in one particular moment as the “[t]ime it takes to decide increase[s] with the number and complexity of choices” (Goldberg, 2022).</p>
<p>On my blog post pages, I need to work on aligning the buttons with the edges of the paragraph, as the alignment sticks out in a way which is noticeable to users and “good alignment is invisible” (Goldberg, 2022). I would like the ‘previous’ button to be aligned with the left side of the paragraph, the top button in the middle and the ‘next’ button to always be aligned with the right side of the paragraph. I would also like to make sure the references align with the main text. The blog post pages make predominant use of straight edges for alignment as straight lines are seen as being more serious.</p>

<p>Another change I would like to make is to ensure that my mouse cursor changes appropriately. I want the mouse cursor to clearly communicate the function of the element on which the user is hovering in order to avoid mistakes. Mistakes in this context are conscious errors the user makes when their idea of how the website works is different to how the website actually functions (Goldberg, 2022). I also think that even though my website does provide immediate feedback i.e. when the mouse hovers over a clickable object it turns into a pointer cursor, and the element will change colour, it would be beneficial if there was also a sound effect, that way feedback would be audible and visual. However, I think it may only be beneficial to add sound design to elements of my website in which the user requires the most feedback as feedback should be “minimal” and “proportional to action’s importance” (Blair-Early and Zender, 2008).</p>
<p>Big improvements I am planning to incorporate on my website is the scrolling effect which can be seen on Apple’s website, which enables an animations to run when the user scrolls through the webpage. I plan to add these animations in, but with small snippets from the Studio Ghibli movie running when the user scrolls. I would also like to allow the user to customise some aspect of the website, whether that be by uploading a profile picture or saving their favourite movie data, however, this would require me to do some more research on the back-end as personalised information would need to be saved on some sort of database.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this reflection looks at how I planned to create a user experience which provoked certain positive emotions and mistakes I have made which disrupted this experience such as alignment issues. It also looked at future improvements, I plan to implement such as sound design as part of my immediate feedback, customisation as well as mimicking Apple’s scrolling effect which they use throughout their website.</p>
