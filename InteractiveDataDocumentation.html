    <h1>Planning Documentation for Interactive Data Visualisation</h1>

<p>
    With my previous submission, I had a stand-alone graph with datapoints and labels. 
    I made use of a scatter graph to compare the ratings that all 22 of the Studio Ghibli movies had received against the time they were released and their length in minutes.
    I then highlighted the trends I wanted the viewer to notice immediatly in a seperate colour.
    Even though this method worked well to convey my point about the visualisation, it did not communicate which movies corresponded to the data points that were mapped out on the graph.
</p>


<p>
    To solve the issue of data points not communicating which movies they were representing.
    I decided to add in another panel next to my graph. 
    This panel displayed information such as the title, movie desctiprion and the official movie cover.
    I added it on the side, to avoid cluttering the graph, but also so that I could add in a variety of information about the movie without overloading the graph.
    The information is triggered by mouseover. 
    That way when the user hovers over a data point, the panel changes accordingly to the data point which was last interacted with.
    The data points turn bright red to indicate that the user has hovered over it.
    All data points remain red, to communicate that the user has viewed that data point's corresponding information.
    In the nect submission I am planning on adding in a function which hightlights the current selected data point in a different colour, and then previously viewed data points in red, whilst unviewed data points remain blue.
